# Ruby OOP Pro

## Overview

This repository contains the Ruby script used to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Ruby. The tutorial covers the foundational concepts of OOP including Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction, with practical examples implemented in Ruby.

## Features

- **Encapsulation**: Showcases how data and methods can be bundled together within classes.
- **Inheritance**: Demonstrates how classes can inherit features from other classes to promote code reusability.
- **Polymorphism**: Explores how the same method can have different behaviors based on the object it is called upon.
- **Abstraction**: Illustrates how to interact with objects without needing to understand complex details.
